What would happen if we never knew about the normal distribution?
========================================================

This story is a very sad story about a world without a Normal distribution.  As a statistician it is very difficult to imagine a world without the Normal distribution.  She is the queen of the distributions!  She is very elegant with a perfect symmetric shape, and a lot of the other curves aspire to her ideal unimodal and symmetric shape. Some of the other curves, like gamma or exponential, have a lot of asymmetry that is difficult to change. 


Here is our queen…...

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
normal<-rnorm(10000)
library(ggplot2)
qplot(normal,geom='histogram',binwidth=.25)+geom_density(colour='red')
```
But what would a world without our queen be?? What would happen in a world that hadn't discovered this magic curve?  Suppose that we live in a world where people are holding our queen hostage.  These people are at terrible kind of evil hippie who are so dedicated to saving a few sheets of tables in the back of statistics textbooks that they have taken our queen hostage so that no one knows about her.  So, there's no need for normal quantile and p-value tables and many trees are rescued. These are our queen's evil captors!

We may have saved some trees, but is this conservation of a few trees worth the cost of living without our queen?? 

Could be the distruibution of 

What would happen to the Kindom of distributions?! The beautiful Queen was missing.  Would the distribution kingdom turn into a democracy?
```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
x = c(rep (c(1:10),5))
qplot(x, binwidth=.5) # uniform distribution
```
Many scientists performed experiments and could not tell if the results were significantly different from the Null Hypothesis, for most of them had only used the normal distribution.  The engineers were unable use the scientist's results to design or improve technology.  A vast majority of statisticians became non-parametric statisticians for they were so devoted to their Normal Distribution Queen that none of the other distributions appealed to them.

In those dark times, it turns out the Queen had three children.  They were merely students (student's t distributions) and were off at university getting their 30 required degrees.  From youngest to oldest, they had 3, 10 and 25 degrees (of freedom).
```{r fig.height=3}
c1 = rt(100000,3)
qplot(c1, binwidth=0.25)
c2 = rt(100000,10)
qplot(c2, binwidth=0.25)
c3 = rt(100000,25)
qplot(c3, binwidth=0.25)
```
The scientists, the engineers, and especially the statisticians begged the students to come back and find their Queen mother and return the the world to its beautiful normalness.  So the three children left their studies and set out, crossing the waves of monotony...
```{r fig.width=8,fig.height=1.5}
x=c(1:(100*pi))/5
y=sin(x)
qplot(x,y, geom="line")
```

In a parellel dimension, the normal distribution was never discovered.  Therefore there was no sampling theory.  If you were studying sizes of oranges, you had to measure the sizes of ALL of the oranges. You had no idea if the next sample would also be normally distributed.  

hmm restart. 

1) Normal Distribution exists but is not discovered.
- the normal distribution is using samples to summarize the entire population.  Most of the population is near an average.
- therefore without a normal or any "distribution," researchers would have to measure the entire population. They could not assume that the next sample would match the current sample.

2) Normal Distribution does not exist.
- the world revolves around a uniform, gamma, exponential distribution, other
- maybe it doesn't even have a distribution
- non normal distributions: uniform, gamma, exponential, cycling (sin/cos, tangent etc)
- music

Non-Normal Distributions:

Bimodal
```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
library(ggplot2)
x = rnorm(1000)
x1=x+5
x = c(x,x1)
qplot(x,)
```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```


We know that at the end all the problems when we have enough information we get a Normal distribution. But what happened if the Normal distribution does not exists? This means that with a huge sample size for some specific problem we will not get our precious Normal curve? Mmmm  difficult to believe …….
